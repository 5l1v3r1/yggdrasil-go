## [0.2.3] - 2018-06-29
### Added
- Begin keeping changelog (incomplete and possibly inaccurate information before this point).
- Build RPMs in CircleCI using alien. This provides package support for Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS and other RPM-based distributions.

### Changed
- Local backpressure improvements.
- Change `box_pub_key` to `key` in admin API for simplicity.
- Session cleanup.

## [0.2.2] - 2018-06-21
### Added
- Add `yggdrasilconf` utility for testing with the `vyatta-yggdrasil` package.
- Add a randomized retry delay after TCP disconnects, to prevent synchronization livelocks.

### Changed
- Update build script to strip by default, which significantly reduces the size of the binary.
- Add debug `-d` and UPX `-u` flags to the `build` script.
- Start pprof in debug builds based on an environment variable (e.g. `PPROFLISTEN=localhost:6060`), instead of a flag.

### Fixed
- Fix typo in big-endian BOM so that both little-endian and big-endian UTF-16 files are detected correctly.

## [0.2.1] - 2018-06-15
### Changed
- The address range was moved from `fd00::/8` to `200::/7`. This range was chosen as it is marked as deprecated. The change prevents overlap with other ULA privately assigned ranges.

### Fixed
- UTF-16 detection conversion for configuration files, which can particularly be a problem on Windows 10 if a configuration file is generated from within PowerShell.
- Fixes to the Debian package control file.
- Fixes to the launchd service for macOS.
- Fixes to the DHT and switch.

## [0.2.0] - 2018-06-13
### Added
- Exchange version information during connection setup, to prevent connections with incompatible versions.

### Changed
- Wire format changes (backwards incompatible).
- Less maintenance traffic per peer.
- Exponential back-off for DHT maintenance traffic (less maintenance traffic for known good peers).
- Iterative DHT (added some time between v0.1.0 and here).
- Use local queue sizes for a sort of local-only backpressure routing, instead of the removed bandwidth estimates, when deciding where to send a packet.

### Removed
- UDP peering, this may be added again if/when a better implementation appears.
- Per peer bandwidth estimation, as this has been replaced with an early local backpressure implementation.

## [0.1.0] - 2018-02-01
### Added
- Adopt semantic versioning.

### Changed
- Wire format changes (backwards incompatible).
- Many other undocumented changes leading up to this release and before the next one.

## [0.0.1] - 2017-12-28
### Added
- First commit.
- Initial public release.
